# Binary_Classification
Discriminative Neural Network Model for Binary Classification of Images
The source code is designed with a neural network mindset and tested over some basic datasets. It focuses on distinguishing a particular class of object from the others. 
A multilayered network helps in classification of the random image entity. Primarily the program was tested over a cat's dataset and had an accuracy of around 80%. Moreover, the performance can be further improved with much more better choice of hyperparameeters. 
#The program is built for just learning purpose since it is quite easy to understand and could be helpful for beginners.
